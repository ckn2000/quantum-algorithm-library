1. While an undergraduate at Carleton College, I took a course on Quantum Computating taught by Dr. Joshua Davis. One of the course's objective is to build a library of Python functions that simulate almost all of our quantum computations. Here is my attempt at an implementation. 
2. In file qAlgorithms.py, I imported the library scipy.linalg to help with
finding the column with free variables in the gamma matrix in Simon's algorithm.
It helps if (is necessary that) you (hopefully) have scipy.linalg downloaded on
your computer to run this.
3. In file qUtilities.py, I imported the library fractions to help with the
continuedFraction function. It helps if (is necessary that) you (hopefully)
have fractions downloaded on your computer to run this.
